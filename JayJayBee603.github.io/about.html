      <br><h2>Hi, I'm Asher Dechrai</h2><br>
      <p>I am Asher
        Joy Dechrai, and my business is In-Joy Move. I first started in the
        gym in 2022, where my male friends had taken me in and showed me the
        basics. I didn’t know what I was doing, I thought everyone was
        watching me, and I felt I looked stupid and masculine to be lifting
        weights as a girl. But I followed a few social media influencers and
        went to the gym more often and began driving to look stronger and
        thinner. The reason I started going by myself, too frequently for my
        health, was because of insecurity and feeling emotionally weak. As
        time went on, I grew a natural interest in biology and the human
        body, and realised that movement was far more than achieving an
        aesthetics goal- it healed and strengthened your body systems and
        mental health in numerous ways. Being able to lift heavy and more
        each week made me feel accomplished and self assured. Seeing my
        friends and family struggle with getting enough quality and enjoyable
        exercise is what drives me to become a personal trainer. I want the
        way exercise is viewed to change, and for my clients to find joy and
        passion in moving their bodies. I understand that exercise has been
        given stereotypes for being a “boys thing”, so sport and physical
        recreation is pushing girls out of the ring. The gym is intimidating
        for women in the weights room- even though its even more important
        for women to have strong bones due to them degrading faster as we
        age. So I want to gear my training towards women of all ages and
        stages. From youth speciality, to elderly and pregnant training, I
        want to empower women to feel comfortable and happy in fitness.</p>
